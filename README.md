# Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Case Study

This project demonstrates an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of employee salaries, showcasing techniques such as data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in Python. It serves as an implementation of a tutorial by Mustafa Othman on YouTube.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Perform EDA to gain insights into employee salary trends, job titles, and other relevant metrics.
- **Dataset**: `Salaries.csv`
- **Key Features**:
  - Cleaning and handling missing data.
  - Statistical analysis (e.g., mean, max).
  - Text analysis on job titles.
  - Grouping and aggregating data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python_EDA_Case_Study.git
```
2. Navigate to the notebook directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebook/Python_EDA_Case_Study.ipynb
```

## Inspiration
This project is based on an excellent YouTube tutorial by [Mustafa Othman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed0P_CVjJcM). The tutorial provides an easy-to-follow introduction to EDA for beginners.
